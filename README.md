Mario
=====

A C++ clone of the classic Super Mario Bros. games.

Compiling
---------
You will need a compiler supporting C++11.
So far, only mingw-w64-g++ 4.8 on Windows has been used, although the code is very portable.
You will also need the following libraries:
-SDL2
-SDL2_mixer
-opengl
-DevIL
-boost

Resources
---------
These are needed to run the game in it's current form.
I've shared them publicly in my Dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/l6wtp2es6y67s26/AAAqBaica5-9Ut9Rr80J5sTAa?dl=0
Copy everything from there to the /resources directory.

Documentation
-------------
This varies depending on the source file.
Some are well documented, others could use some serious work.
If you follow the path of execution from Main.cpp it should be self-explanitory for the most part.

License
-------
I haven't formally decided on a license for this project yet.
Seeing that it uses a lot of copyrighted Nintendo assets, I'd say it's public domain for now.
